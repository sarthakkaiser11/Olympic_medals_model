# Olympic_medals_model
Designed and implemented a predictive model to forecast the performance of athletes in international sports events, specifically focusing on medal counts. Leveraged machine learning techniques to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of medals an athlete or team is expected to win based on various factors such as past performance and number of athletes.
